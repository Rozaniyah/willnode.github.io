## TEXDraw

I worked solo for TEXDraw for more than two years with ongoing support for every month. TEXDraw covers many aspect including UI Algorithm until Asset pipelines and editor tools. The best aspect in TEXDraw is it's work out the box and it's fastest runtime LaTeX generator with zero GC allocations!

## Engine4

Engine4 is an experimental project (yes, despite it is a premium asset) to enable 4D game development in Unity. It is packed with range of Algorithm and Editor implementation to get ready experimenting with 4D game developments. The best part from having Engine4 is you no longer have to crazy thinking rendering and physics detail from 4D algorithms!
